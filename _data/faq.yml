- question: What/why/how is cocktail attire?
  answer: |
    Paraphrased from <a href=https://www.theknot.com/content/cocktail-wedding-attire)>The Knot<a/>:

      Cocktail wedding attire is a slightly more elevated dress code than semi-formal attire but is less formal than formal wedding attire (also known as black-tie optional). However, there are a few nuances that help differentiate a cocktail attire wedding from a semi-formal wedding. For both dress codes, a suit is preferable for men, while women should opt for a cocktail dress or *formal jumpsuit*. (emphasis mine) "Cocktail attire challenges you to be creative," says Greg Shugar, CEO and Creative Director of Beau Ties Ltd. "No color is off limits. No pattern is off-limits. And no specific mix or color or pattern is off limits."

    Tl;dr basically formal-adjacent. (Suit/jacket not necessary, i)
