- question: Can I take pictures during the ceremony?
  answer: |
  We're having a religious ceremony and would strongly prefer that people put away their phones during the ceremony itself.

- question: What are your COVID-19 precautions?
  answer: |
  We will have masks available for guests. We have seated 5-6 people per table and each table typically seats 8, so there will be some extra space between folks. There is also a wall of garage door windows that will be open during the ceremony and reception, so there will be good air flow. If you don't feel comfortable with that level of risk, we'll be sad to learn that you can't make it but are glad you're making the best decision for you and your health! We strongly encourage everyone to take a rapid test the day of the wedding. If you test positive (before or after the wedding), please let us know immediately.

- question: Do you have a registry?
  answer: |
  We are not registered anywhere. Your presence is enough of a gift! If you would like to get us something, we will happily accept monetary gifts or anything that you think we'd think is cool.

- question: Should I wear a kippah?
  answer: |
  Kippot are traditionally worn by Jewish men, though now Jewish people of all genders wear them. We will have them available so that anyone can wear one if they would like to do so, but do not feel obligated to wear one -- it's completely optional and up to your preference/comfort level.

    Yes. We will be using <a href="https://www.lovecastapp.com/">Lovecast</a> for the livestream and our event's link is: <a href="https://loveca.st/zanddow">https://loveca.st/zanddow</a>.

We'll provide N95 respirators and surgical masks at the event for anyone who wants to use one.
